# Resources Supporting SDS 220

## Inclusivity for all students

Smith is committed to providing support services and reasonable accommodations to all students with disabilities. Please inform me early in the term if there are aspects of the course that need to be modified to serve your learning, health, or person. You may speak with me after class, during student hours, or during an appointment. To request an accommodation, please register with the Disability Services Office at the beginning of the semester. To begin the process, either call 413-585-2071 or email ods@smith.edu.

Students in need of short-term academic advice or support can contact your class dean in the Dean of the College office. If you require some accommodation for religious or cultural purposes, please do not hesitate to talk to me about this. 


## Spinelli Center

The Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning is a resource to support students as they take STEM courses and as they engage in other quantitative work. To see the list of available peer tutors and other resources available at the Spinelli Center, please consult their [website](https://www.smith.edu/qlc/tutoring.html). 

## Jacobson Center

Smith has an additional resource for writing support: the Jacobson Center for Writing, Teaching & Learning make an appointment to take your work to the Jacobson Center on [their website](https://www.smith.edu/academics/jacobson-center). In particular, you may choose to bring your work to Peer Writing Tutors Elisabeth Nesmith or Elina Gordon-Halpern, both SDS majors who tutor for the Jacobson Center. Contact Sara Eddy (seddy@smith.edu) for more information about their schedules or how to make an appointment.

## Library

Our book is freely available on the web as a part of the OpenIntro project. 

:::{note}
The web-native version of our book _Introduction to Modern Statistics_ can be found [here](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/)

The library is a huge resource and the librarians are eager to help you with this (or any other) class!

Please note that for anything denoted as an E-Book at the library, there are limits placed on how many people can view the source. Instead, you can download sections (or whole books) for a period of time directly from the library.

## Student Hours

Student hours are **drop-in hours.** These hours are for _you_ to meet with me about anything! They are times on my calendar with _nothing else_ on them. 

I encourage you to add student hours to your weekly calendar. Below is an incomplete list of great reasons to come to student hours: 
- You haven’t made it to student hours yet 
- You want to see where my office is
- You have a question on a reading, assignment, or activity
- You want to share about the course, your time at Smith, or about yourself
- You read something about data visualization, computer science, statistics, or math that you have questions about
- You are thinking about what you want to do after Smith
- You heard there’s a robot in my office
- You are wandering campus and want somewhere to work for a minute

This semester, student hours are Mondays from 1:30pm to 3:30pm, Fridays from 9am to 10am, and by appointment. 

Due to the pandemic, student hours and appointments will happen: 
- in-person in my office or research space
- in-person, outdoors
- on zoom


### Appointments 

You are welcome and encouraged to make individual appointments with me. To make an appointment, please check my appointments calendar (also linked on our Moodle site) for appointment slots that are set aside each week. If those times do not work for you, please slack me with at least two possible meeting times that work for you. 

Please note that due to the pandemic, most appointments will be on zoom. If you prefer to meet in person, please do not hesitate to let me know. 

### Instructor information 

The instructor for this course is Katherine Kinnaird. My office is room 208 in McConnell Hall. My email is kkinnaird@smith.edu. My student hours are Mondays from 1:30pm to 3:30pm, Fridays from 9am to 10am, and by appointment.
