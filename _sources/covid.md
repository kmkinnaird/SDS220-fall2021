# Learning in a Pandemic

## Attending class

We are still in the midst of a global pandemic. In keeping with the 
[Guidelines](https://www.smith.edu/covid19/guidelines-policies) laid out in 
Smith's Culture of Care, if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms, 
please do **not** come to _in-person_ class. Instead, please log in on zoom. 
The link can be found on our Moodle site and our slack space. 

You do not need to email me to ask permission to come to class over zoom or in person. However, if you are not able to be in-person for 3 consecutive meetings, then we need to check in. 

Similarly, do not come to student hours nor appointments if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms. There will be a zoom link for student hours and a zoom link can be provided for any in-person appointment. 

:::{warning}
Do **NOT** come to in-person class or student hours, if you are ill and/or have any COVID symptoms. 
:::

Failure to respect this policy will result in an email to both the class dean and your advisor. 


## What if we have to go remote?
