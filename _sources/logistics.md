# Course Logistics

## Class Meeting Times

The course has two parts: Lecture and Lab. The lecture meets Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays in Sabin-Reed 301 from 10:50am to 12:05pm. Half of the class will be in Lab 1 which meets Thursdays from 9:25am to 10:40am also in Sabin-Reed 301. Another half of the class will be in Lab 2 which also meets Thursdays in Sabin-Reed 301, but from 10:50am to 12:05pm. In supporting our course community, students should make every effort to be at our lecture and lab meetings on time.

### Attending Lecture and Lab

We are still in the midst of a global pandemic. In keeping with the 
[Guidelines](https://www.smith.edu/covid19/guidelines-policies) laid out in 
Smith's Culture of Care, if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms, 
please do **not** come to _in-person_ class. Instead, please log in on zoom. 
The link can be found on our Moodle site and our slack space. 

You do not need to email me to ask permission to come to class over zoom or in person. However, if you are not able to be in-person for 3 consecutive meetings, then we need to check in. 

Similarly, do not come to student hours nor appointments if you are ill and/or have _any_ COVID symptoms. There will be a zoom link for student hours and a zoom link can be provided for any in-person appointment. 

:::{warning}
Do **NOT** come to in-person class or student hours, if you are ill and/or have any COVID symptoms. 
:::

Failure to respect this policy will result in an email to both the class dean and your advisor. 

### Pivoting Class Meetings

If I am unwell and/or experiencing any symptoms of COVID, class will be held on zoom. If this happens, I will send a slack message on the #general channel using the @everyone mention. Using @everyone should send an email to your inbox. 

## Communication

In addition to our synchronous meetings, our class will make of electronic communication, including our class slack, email, and Moodle messages. These methods of communication represent differing levels of formality and collaboration:

- **Slack:** Our slack site is the primary form of course communication. It allows for us to share where we are stuck with a reading, idea, or assignment, and where we can add helpful hints, request study groups, or share interesting news articles. Slack is much less formal than email, and salutations and signatures are not required. If you need to ask your instructor a question, this is the best place to do it either over a public channel or through direct message. 
- **Email:** Email communication is more formal than slack. It should be used in the cases that 1) concern something personal, 2) require attachments, or 3) involve a number of people (who should be copied on the email). We also will use email to confirm individual appointments. Emails to the instructor should include a salutation and a signature. 
- **Slack Mentions:** When I need to communicate with the whole class on a time-sensitive manner, I will use the @everybody or @channel functionality in slack. Please check that your slack settings will notify you either via slack or email. If you are using the email notifications, please be sure that your email does not treat these messages as spam.
- **Slack Emojis:** At times, I will ask you to emoji a message to show that you have read the message. This is a quick way for you to signal that you read it. If there's something that you have a question about in a "please emoji" message, please use the threading function for that message or send me a direct message on slack. 

:::{note}
Please sign up for [our slack site](smi-sds-220-01-202201.slack.com), add a profile picture, and introduce yourself with your name and a fun-fact about yourself on the #intros channel. After signing up, please determine how and where you will get notifications from slack. 
:::

Please note that on a typical workday, I leave my office just after 3:30pm. This means that emails and slack messages sent after 3:30pm will likely be received on the next business day. Similarly e-communication sent on the weekend will likely not be received until Monday.
