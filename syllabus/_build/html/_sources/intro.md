# Welcome to SDS 220

I am so excited that you'll be joining this educational journey through 
statistics! You are now, just by being here, a statistician. This course will 
help us frame out exactly what that means and also what _statistics_ is.

### Official Course Description

An application-oriented introduction to modern statistical inference: study 
design, descriptive statistics; random variables; probability and sampling 
distributions; point and interval estimates; hypothesis tests, resampling 
procedures and multiple regression. A wide variety of applications from the 
natural and social sciences are used. Classes meet for lecture/discussion and 
for a required laboratory that emphasizes analysis of real data. SDS 220 
satisfies the basic requirement for biological science, engineering, 
environmental science, neuroscience and psychology. 

#### Motivating Questions

There are a few questions motivating our course work: 
- What is Statistics? 
- What role does data play in statistics? 
- What habits of mind do we need to develop to be effective and ethical 
statisticians?

#### Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, ~students~ statisticians will be able to...
1. Responsibly use sample data to learn about a larger population, using 
exploratory and inferential statistics - _Create Statistics_
2. Detail the power and limitations of statistical concepts, and use this 
understanding to evaluate statistics from various contexts - 
_Evaluate Statistics_
3. Explain the connection between probability and inferential statistics - 
_Connect Statistical Concepts_
4. Work collaboratively, responsibly, and reflectively to create and present 
statistics to a wide variety of audiences - _Communicate with Statistics_ 


## Syllabus 

This webpage and the associated links together function as the syllabus. 
Everything that you need to know about the course is either here or linked from here. 

The course syllabus is the most important document underlying the culture of 
our course and our classroom. I view my syllabus as a sacred document that 
both introduces and governs the course. In taking this view, I work to detail 
as much about the course as possible from the big picture ideas to the minute 
details of course policies. I believe that the first activity a student should 
do when beginning a course is to carefully read and examine the syllabus. In 
keeping with that belief, there are a few tasks in this document that will 
help us build our course community.

Please read the syllabus this week and 
complete these tasks to help shape our community. If you have questions about the syllabus, please ask them!
