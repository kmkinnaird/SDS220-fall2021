# Assignments

To prepare students to tackle the courseâ€™s motivating questions - especially _What habits of mind do we need to develop to be effective and ethical 
statisticians?_ -  there are a variety of assignments in this course. Each week will be a mix of reading about topics in statistics, discussing and debating concepts, putting our readings into practice, and constant reflection about our learning and professional development. All due dates are posted on the Detailed Course Schedule and are due on the stated dates at 10am.
