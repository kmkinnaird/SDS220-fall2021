# Assignments

To prepare students to tackle the course’s motivating questions - especially _What habits of mind do we need to develop to be effective and ethical 
statisticians?_ -  there are a variety of assignments in this course. Each week will be a mix of reading about topics in statistics, discussing and debating concepts, putting our readings into practice, and constant reflection about our learning and professional development. All due dates are posted on the Detailed Course Schedule and are due on the stated dates at 10am.

## Engagement & Class Preparation 

For each lecture meeting and lab, there will be readings and/or a pre-class activity. These readings and activities are intended to be your first contact with the course material. Engaging with these materials in good faith _before_ class will help you get the most out of the in-class activities. 


## Group Problem Sets (GPsets)

Group Problem Sets are designed to be completed in class with possibly some work out of class to clarify details that your group discussed. The goal of these GPsets is to put the ideas from the readings and pencasts to work in examples. 

GPsets are due on **Thursdays at 10am** unless otherwise noted on the Detailed Course Schedule. Often there will be more than one GPset due on each Thursday. Please consult the Detailed Course Schedule. 

## Labs

The labs are designed to be completed in class with some work out of class to practice the ideas from the pre-lab assignments. These are due on **Fridays at 10am** unless otherwise noted on the Detailed Course Schedule. 

## Projects 

There will be one group project for the semester. In this project, you will use what we have learned in this class to investigate one data set of your choosing. There will be lab time set aside to work on the project. 

The project will also scaffold explicit development of writing skills that SDS has laid out in [our writing plan](https://www.smith.edu/sites/default/files/media/Documents/Jacobson-Center/SDS-WritingPlan-accessible.pdf). Specifically, our course will focus on three of the listed writing goals: 
* Writing Goal 2 - Engage in a writing process that includes brainstorming, outlining, initial drafting, peer review, editing, and revising; 
* Writing Goal 4 - Prioritize the important parts of the process and/or project to communicate
* Writing Goal 5 - Clearly communicating the research question and how analysis will support the question in the introduction. 

## Starred Problems

Each week, you will complete a starred problem. The goals of these problems are to 1) apply what we’ve discussed in class on your own, 2) reflect on your learning so far, and 3) practice for the knowledge checks. To accomplish these goals, starred problems will all follow the same procedure: 

0. Study what we have learned so far
1. Put away all course resources
2. Download that week’s starred problem off Moodle
3. Write your solution to the problem and upload it into Moodle
4. Once properly uploaded, the instructor solution will appear
5. Compare your solution to the instructor solution 
6.Complete a reflection worksheet about this problem and what you would like to review as a result of doing this problem

These problems are based on completion (ie. you get the credit or not) based on both your solution and the content of your reflection. This means that you can get the problem totally wrong and still get full credit if you take the time to honestly reflect on your progress. This assignment structure is based on an assignment structure from Smith’s Engineering Program. 


## Knowledge Checks 

There are 4 Knowledge Checks, during which you can collect statistics medals. There are 15 medals, each representing core skills for the course. During each knowledge check, you can attempt as many or as few medals as you would like. Your goal, by the end of the semester, is to collect all 15 medals.

The first badge challenge will have the first 5 medals available, the second will have the first 10, and the third and fourth knowledge check will have all 15 medals. You do not need to (nor should you) attempt all medals on each knowledge check, but you do need to collect all 15 medals by the end of the term. 

:::{note}
The weekly starred problems will be in the style of the knowledge check questions.

### Statistics Medals

The 15 medals that represent core skills for the course are listed below, in the order that they appear in the course: 

1. Describe and evaluate context for a statistic, statistical test, or procedure, including any sampling biases and the data collection design
2. Compute and contextualize notions of typical and spread
3. Create appropriate graphical summaries given the data and context of the data; Articulate the limitations and strengths of each type of graphical summary
4. Compare and contrast sample distributions and sampling distributions; Compare and contrast sampling and resampling; Compute and accurately describe standard error to a non-expert
5. Compute and accurately describe confidence intervals to a non-expert; Articulate how confidence intervals relate to statistical inference
6. Compute appropriate probabilities within a given context; State and apply Bayes' Rule
7. State the four steps of a hypothesis test; Relate hypothesis testing to probability distributions; Detail the limits and potential abuses of hypothesis testing
8. Define Type I and Type II errors; Explain how Type I and Type II are connected
9. Describe issues of running multiple hypotheses in one hypothesis test to both an expert (using probabilistic ideas for support) and a non-expert
10. Create linear models; Detail the meaning of each coefficient in a contextually meaningful fashion
11. Evaluate linear models using statistical measures; Articulate limits and potential abuses of using linear models
12. Identify potential confounding variables; Identify if, where, and how Simpson’s paradox is at play in a given context
13. State and apply the Central Limit Theorem; Describe how the Central Limit Theorem relates to the normal distribution
14. Describe the normal distribution including detailing features related to skew and standard deviation; articulate the differences between normal and t-distributions; articulate the differences between cumulative and density curves
15. Apply ANOVA and χ^2 tests appropriately, articulating each step of the tests

## Weekly flow for the course 

Each week, you will have group problem sets, a lab and either a starred problem or a knowledge check due each week. The course will operate as follows:

| Day    | Course Preparation and/or Activity | Assignment due |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Monday     | Group Problem Set in class | Starred problem |
| Wednesday     | Group Problem Set in class | (none) |
| Thursday     | Lab in Class| Group Problem sets from Monday, Wednesday, and previous Friday |
| Friday     | Group Problem Set in class | Lab from Thursday |
